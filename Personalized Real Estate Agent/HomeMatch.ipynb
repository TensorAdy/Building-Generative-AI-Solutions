    "# HomeMatch: The AI-Driven Real Estate Personalization Agent\n",
    "## *Synopsis*\n",
    "HomeMatch utilizes advanced large language models (LLMs) and vector databases to convert typical property listings into personalized recommendations that meet each buyer's unique preferences and needs.\n",
    "## *Overview of the Process*\n",
    "####  <u>1. Python Application Setup</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLM library: OpenAI's GPT\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector database package: ChromaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>2. Creating Property Listings</u>\n",
    "Generate property descriptions using a Large Language Model by crafting prompts for the LLM to produce various property descriptions.These genearted listings will populate the vector database for HomeMatch's testing and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>3. Saving Listings in a Vector Database</u>\n",
    "Set up and configure the ChromaDB vector database to store the property listings. Transform the LLM-generated listings into appropriate embeddings that reflect each listing's semantic content, and save these embeddings into the vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>4. Developing the User Preference Interface</u>\n",
    "Gather buyer preferences, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other specific criteria through a set of questions. The questions and answers can be hardcoded in the buyer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>5. Conducting Preference-Based Searches</u>\n",
    "Semantic Search Implementation: Use the structured buyer preferences to perform a semantic search on the vector database, retrieving listings that most closely match the user's requirements.\n",
    "Listing Retrieval Logic: Fine-tune the retrieval algorithm to ensure that the most relevant listings are selected based on the semantic closeness to the buyer’s preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>6. Personalizing Listing Descriptions</u>\n",
    "LLM Augmentation: For each retrieved listing, use the LLM to augment the description, tailoring it to resonate with the buyer’s specific preferences. This involves subtly emphasizing aspects of the property that align with what the buyer is looking for.\n",
    "Maintaining Factual Integrity: Ensure that the augmentation process enhances the appeal of the listing without altering factual information."
